The forest around you pulses with an otherworldly energy, and wisps of silver mist dance between the towering trunks. Your memories are fragmented—flashes of a distant life, a purpose you can't quite grasp. The air tastes of secrets and forgotten magic.

They flicker and change, a slideshow of suffering and madness, before settling on one final image: your original face, but twisted with the accumulated guilt of countless atrocities. The reflection speaks: 'Look at what you've become. Look at what you've always been.' The mirror begins to crack, each fracture revealing a different aspect of your personality—the caring doctor, the curious scientist, the sadistic experimenter, the coward who refused to face the consequences. All of them are you, and all of them are fighting for control.",

Each level you pass reveals a different era of the asylum: the clean, hopeful beginning; the gradual decline into experimental madness; the final abandonment when the authorities finally understood what you had become. As you fall, you see glimpses of your past selves working at different levels, unaware that they're all part of the same fractured consciousness.

Each recording shows a little more of your humanity slipping away, replaced by scientific curiosity and then by something far darker. The final recording shows you preparing for the consciousness transfer, claiming you're going to preserve human knowledge forever. But your voice already sounds inhuman.",
